You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN user ON reviews.user_id = user.id JOIN business ON reviews.business_id = business.id;

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, user.first_name, user.last_name, business.name FROM reviews JOIN user ON reviews.user_id = user.id JOIN business ON reviews.business_id = business.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
SELECT * FROM reviews JOIN user ON reviews.user_id = user.id JOIN business ON reviews.business_id = business.id WHERE business.id = 1;
