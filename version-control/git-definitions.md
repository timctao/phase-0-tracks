# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

>Version control is a map of changes that can be traced back to the origin that is easily read and understood. It is useful to note what exactly has changed so that if any conflicts occur you can see where it is and how to fix it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

>A branch is a copy of the original master repository that allows you to make changes without affecting the master file. You would use it any time you wanted to make a change to test your code before merging back to the master file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

>A commit is when you make note of a change in any file and record it. A good commit message is detailed and done often after every edit to leave a clear record of what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

>A merge conflict is when a branch and master merge has created an error, usually when two separate branches have changed the same thing.
