	<h2>Why do I like it?</h2>
		<p>
			With <strong>Pok&eacute;mon Go</strong> recently taking over the world by storm, I wanted to let everyone know why I personally enjoy Pok&eacute;mon and, after so many years, keep coming back again and again to continue to enjoy it.
		</p>	
			<ul>
				<li><strong>It provides an escape from reality.</strong></li>
					<p>
						Often times I find myself needing a break from whatever life throws at me, and Pok&eacute;mon always gave me some sort of relief from those responsibiltiies.
					</p>
				<li><strong>It appeals to the collector in me.</strong></li>
					<p>
						I've always enjoyed collecting cards or figurines and the way Pok&eacute;mon was designed was to appeal to people like me. The hunt never ends.
					</p>
				<li><strong>Nostalgia.</strong></li>
					<p>
						Growing up I thought one day I would grow out of these things I deemed "childish," but it is the very fact that Pok&eacute;mon was so much apart of that childhood that it makes me want to keep coming back to see old Pok&eacute;mon and discover new ones.
					</p>
				<li><strong>Some are pretty darn cute.</strong></li>
					<p>
						Need I say any more?
					</p>
			</ul>
