## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a simulated computer experience, allowing you to access a computer terminal through a server hosted on the internet. You pay to allot a specific amount of space, and it allows you to act as if you have your own computer in front of you, whereas in reality it's being hosted by a server somewhere in the world. Some advantages are the affordability and that it is easy to set up. If something goes wrong, you can always restart without a huge impact or damage to your local computer.

## Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Linux allows a huge amount of customization, however it is still important to make a distinction between administrative and user capabilities. Doing tasks as a root user can have many consequences if things go wrong, wasting your time and having you start over from scratch. Also, security issues can arise if everyone is given access to the root user, so it is important to have root/admin and normal users remain separate.
