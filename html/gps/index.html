			<li><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Whcih ones do you see as most useful?</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Semantic tags allow the grouping of similar topics and/or sections for stylistic purposes or to make it easier to read. I've found that the most useful tags are section to separate different sections for later css use and nav, to easily find the area that I can place links to other sites or pages.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A browser displays elements from html or css from the top going down.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I learned that you can actually program sublime a little bit just to make things more efficient. I will probably create my own snippets in the future once I know what I'm doing.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I think certain semantic tags are a little difficult for me to wrap my head around how to use them. Now that I've been learning how to program html I think I can go to different sites to inspect the code to see how they use certain tags to help me better understand how to use them in specific contexts.
